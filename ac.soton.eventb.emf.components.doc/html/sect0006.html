<div><h2 id="a0000000007">5.4 Simulation of Component model</h2>
<p> The CODA simulator is based on ProB but provides an interface that is aware of the CODA components model. The interface consists of an additional view that is presented as part of the ProB perspective (the lower view in Figure 11). The simulator is started by right clicking on a machine and selecting Simulation-Start. </p><p>Figure 11 - CODA Simulator User Interface </p><p>5.4.1 Modes </p><p>During simulation there are two modes. Recording, where a new gold run is being recorded or playback where a previous gold run is being replayed for comparison. During recording the user controls which operations execute whereas during playback the system controls which operations execute. </p><p>5.4.2 Recording Mode </p><p>During recording mode, operations can be invoked manually from the enabled operations table or via one of the three left hand buttons on the control panel. These buttons have the following functions. Tick N selects operations non-deterministically from those that are enabled until the clock has advanced by the number of clock ticks configured in the adjacent panel. Step selects one operation non-deterministically from those that are enabled. Continue, selects operations non-deterministically from those that are enabled until a choice between two operations of the same component is required. To ensure the latter button terminates a limit (20) of the number of operations is applied. At any point the gold run can be saved by pressing the Save button or discarded by pressing the Restart or Replay buttons. The Restart button remains in record mode and the Replay button switches to playback mode. </p><p>5.4.3 Playback Mode </p><p>During playback mode, a previous gold run is selected and its operations are replayed. Operations may not be selected from the enabled operations table. The three buttons in the control panel have slightly different behaviour. Tick N selects operations from the sequence defined in the gold run until the clock has advanced by the number of clock ticks configured in the adjacent panel. Step selects the next operation from the gold run. Continue, selects operations from the gold run until it is exhausted or the limit (20) of the number of operations is reached. At any point the playback run can be saved by pressing the Save button or discarded by pressing the Restart button. The Restart button remains in playback mode. At any time (whether saved or not) the playback can be left and continued in record mode by pressing the Stop button. This enables a previous gold recording to be extended or a different branch to be taken at any point. </p><p>5.4.4 Summary of Control Buttons </p><ul class="itemize">
<li></li><li><p>Save - [recording | playback] Saves the current trace model and continues in the same mode. (The trace model is a gold run when in recording mode and a normal run in playback mode. </p></li><li><p>Stop - [playback] Leaves playback and continues in recording mode. (The trace from playback is continued so that it can be extended to make a new gold run). When in recording mode, does nothing. </p></li><li><p>Restart - [recording | playback] Discards the current trace and re-starts animation in the same mode as before. (In playback mode, the same gold run is replayed). </p></li><li><p>Replay - [recording] Leaves recording mode and enters playback mode. The current trace is discarded and reset. A gold run for playback is chosen and loaded via a user dialog. </p></li>
</ul><p>Figure 12 - Model of CODA Simulator Operation </p><p>5.4.5 Saved Trace runs </p><p>The gold and playback runs are saved into a folder, called Oracle in the project that is being simulated. The file names for the runs are auto generated using the following scheme. </p><p>Gold runs: &lt;Machine name&gt;.test.&lt;timestamp&gt;.gold.oracle </p><p>Playback runs: &lt;Machine name&gt;.test.&lt;timestamp&gt;.oracle </p></div>
